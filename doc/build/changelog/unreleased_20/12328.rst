    Fixed bug in ORM enabled UPDATE (and theoretically DELETE) where using a
    multi-table DML statement would not allow ORM mapped columns from mappers
    other than the primary UPDATE mapper to be named in the RETURNING clause;
    they would be omitted instead and cause a column not found exception.
